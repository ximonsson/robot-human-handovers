<h1>Learning of robot-to-human object handovers</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
In this thesis we propose a system for robots to learn through a semi-supervised approach from observations, proper handover features for objects that can be applied onto new objects.
</p>

<p>
Using recordings of handovers, features are extracted for the purpose of classifying the objects through unsupervised learning. The results from the classification are used to train a network in a supervised fashion as to properly identify handover class from images.
</p>

<p>
The results of this work show that objects with similar visual features are handed over in similar way and that with a limited amount of data a model can be fitted as to properly predict handover settings for an object that has been previously encountered or not.
