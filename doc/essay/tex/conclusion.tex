Better framework needed for true unsupervised learning:
april tags needed for object detection,
april tags created some unrealistic grasping in some cases
(some research might need to be done on all objects to conclude best grasping),
handover moments were manuallly extracted,
robot would need some internal database of the objects and classify them to keep track of them
while observing handovers.
